# How does One Tab Group compare to other tab management extensions like OneTab and Session Buddy?

Among the many `tab manager` extensions, what’s the differences in them and which one you like best? Here we made a comparison to help you find the one most suitable for you.

# SECTION 1: The common points

`OneTab`, `Session Buddy`, and `One Tab Group` all share a fundamental goal of simplifying tab management. Their main features include:

1. Consolidating all of your `open tabs` into a `single tab` with a list of URLs, which reduces clutter and makes it easier to find and access the pages you need.
2. Allowing you to export your tab list to a text file and `share` it with others, providing easy collaboration options.
3. Providing a way to `restore tabs` that you may have accidentally closed, preventing data loss and frustration.

# SECTION 2: The privacy policy

While both `OneTab` and `One Tab Group` prioritize user privacy by not collecting browsing history or bookmark data, but `Session Buddy` collects information about the web pages you visit, including the page title and time of visit.

This data can be used to help you organize and manage your browsing sessions more effectively, but it may not be suitable for users who prioritize privacy.

It's important to understand the data collection policies of any browser extension you use and make an informed decision based on your own preferences and priorities.

# SECTION 3: Cloud sync and backup

Unlike `OneTab` and `Session Buddy`, `One Tab Group` provides the convenient option to sync and backup your tabs on Cloud. This feature enables you to access your `saved tabs` from any device, ensuring that you can always pick up right where you left off.

Additionally, `One Tab Group` goes a step further by offering the ability to backup your tabs' data in `email` and in `Notion`, a powerful productivity app.

This way, you can keep all your important information in one centralized location and access it from anywhere.

# SECTION 4: Raycast Extension

`One Tab Group` supports search tabs anywhere on MAC by using `Raycast`.

It integrates with Raycast in the form of an extension, leveraging `Raycast's` beautiful UI design and smooth search interaction to enhance the overall search experience for tabs.

This allows you to quickly and effectively find the tabs/tab groups you have saved.

# SECTION 5: Share tabs in web link

Sharing tabs in a `web link` is a convenient way to share `multiple web pages` with others. Both `OneTab` and `One Tab Group` offer this feature.

When you use this feature, the extension creates a single web link that contains all the URLs of the tabs you want to share.

You can then send this link to others via `email` or `messaging apps`, and they can open it to access all the web pages you shared at once.

This is useful for sharing research or resources with `colleagues` or `friends`, or for simply keeping a record of your own browsing history.
